The worse thing to do, in my opinion, and this is something that many producers do, is start from drums and spending a ridiculous 
amount of time on making drums sound good (or any instrument). This sucks out any ideas or inspiration 
(sometimes I simply forget my original idea because of time spent on altering the sound).  

I divide my production in stages and only focus on one at a time. That is to say, there are 3 stages for me: 
sound-design (making sounds of course), production (composing, arranging and editing), 
and then finally the mix-down (making sonic/timbre changes and possibly arrangement alterations too). 
I don't do two things at once. Because one thing distracts me from the other. If I have an idea, 
I want to be able to grab a sound and then get that idea down and repeat this process without coming across 
any distractions or obstacles. If I stop to start focusing on engineering and being fiddly with frequencies and such, 
the motivation and ideas simply dissipate.

## Get Acapella

A great application for phase cancellation is the making of accapellas. If you have an instrumental and the orginal track, 
put them mono and reverse phase of one of the 2 and you get the accapella.

## [Phase cancellation](https://cecm.indiana.edu/etext/acoustics/chapter1_phase2.shtml)
- two identical waves 180 degrees out of phase will completely cancel each other out in a process called phase cancellation or destructive interference making it silence
- two waves with the same frequency and phase will combine to create a single sound of greater amplitudeâ€”this is called constructive interference.

## Saw Wave
- have all harmonics

## Triangle Wave
- have odd number harmonics
